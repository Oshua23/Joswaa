  <h2>Djo -End of Beginning</h2>

 <center>
             <b>Verse: 1 Just one more tear to cry 
                  One teardrop from my eye
                  You better save it for
                 The middle of the night
              When things aren't black and white
              Enter, Troubadour
              Remember twenty-four?</b> <br> 

            <b>Chorus: And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it 
            Another version of me, I was in it
            I wave goodbye to the end of beginning</b>

            <b>Verse:  2 This song has started now
            And you're just finding out
            Now isn't that a laugh?
            A major sacrifice
            But clueless at the time
            Enter, Caroline
            Just trust me, you'll be fine.</b>  
            
            <b>Chorus: And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it
            Another version of me, I was in it
            I wave goodbye to the end of beginning
            (Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
            You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man
            You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man
            You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man
            You take the man out of the
            And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it
            Another version of me, I was in it
            Oh, I wave goodbye to the end of beginning
            (Goodbye, goodbye)</b>
